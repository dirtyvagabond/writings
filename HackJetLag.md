Title: How to Hack Jet Lag with 4 Simple Tools
By Aaron Crow

Using the four simple tools explained in this guide, you can greatly reduce the impact of jet lag on your body and mind. 

As a general rule of thumb, it’s supposed to take about one day to adjust to each hour of time difference, and it’s expected that traveling west to east produces the worst jet lag. However, I’ve used these hacks to travel west to east and acclimate to a 8 hour time difference (Shanghai to Los Angeles) within only 48 hours, rather than the expected one week. Here’s how.
#1: Sleep Control
Aim to achieve at least several hours of genuine, deep sleep on your first night in the new time zone. Ensure you’re exhausted when bedtime rolls around to maximize your chances of getting quality sleep.

Try to stay awake for the entire duration of your flight and throughout the day at your destination. During the day, do whatever it takes to stay awake by planning some exciting daytime travel adventures. When bedtime arrives, you will hopefully be so tired from it all that you can naturally fall asleep.


#2: Natural Sunlight
Your body uses natural sunlight as a critical signal when syncing your internal clocks, so focus on exposing yourself to natural sunlight in your new location as much as possible. Follow these guidelines based on the direction and distance traveled.

If you traveled on an eastbound flight and the time difference is:
less than 6 hours, sunlight in the morning is especially valuable.
6 to 10 hours, then avoid sunlight in the morning and put a priority on getting light at midday.

less than 6 hours, then sunlight in the afternoon is especially valuable.
6 to 10 hours, then avoid sunlight in the morning and put a priority on getting light at midday.
#3: Drugs
As difficult as it might be, it’s critically important to avoid real sleep during the day. Similarly, the more you sleep at night early on in your trip, the faster you will adjust to your new time zone. A reasonable selection of over-the-counter drugs is useful to help you sleep when it’s time to sleep, and help you stay awake when it’s time to be awake. (WARNING: I am not a doctor. You should always consult your personal physician before taking any of the below.) 

My personal preferences are:

Sublingual melatonin as a gentle sleep aid. I take 3mg about 1 hour before it’s time to sleep.
Actifed (or a similar drowsiness-inducing antihistamine) as a not-so-gentle sleep aid. I take it when it’s clear that I won’t be able sleep any other way.
Strong coffee to stay awake during the day time. I use it ruthlessly in the morning to help me avoid the typical jet lag crash during the day. However, I’m careful to taper off early in the day so that it doesn’t interfere with my sleep that night.
#4: Fasting
A study done the Harvard Medical School indicates that fasting makes it far easier to trigger a reset of your internal clock once you start eating again. The study suggests that fasting 16 hours is enough to activate the trigger. But for those of us who can’t wait 16 hours for that first foreign fare, try to fast for at least half a day before you eat your first meal in the new time zone. Then, start eating meals at the appropriate local time, based on your normal eating schedule back home. If you normally have a large breakfast at 8AM, then have a large breakfast at 8AM in your new location. 

The best strategy is to stop eating some number of hours before your flight and simply avoid food until you’re in the new place. If you’re like me and despise airplane food, this probably won’t be a problem for you. 

Lastly, be sure to drink plenty of water throughout. 
Now go beat jet lag!
Each tool requires some amount of discipline and planning, but if it’s important to you to make a quick transition, then it’s worth it. Used together, these tools are powerful and will maximize your chances of success. 

If you’re not interested (or not able) to use all four tools, the ones that you’re willing to try should still offer significant help dealing with jet lag.

Have fun traveling!
